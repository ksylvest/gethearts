        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p>
          Hearts is a game where players must evade taking points (Hearts and
          the Queen of Spades) or boldly attempt to collect all points and shoot
          the moon! The game originated in Spain in the 1700â€™s, and requires a
          mix of memory and strategy to be played well.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hearts requires four players (our game provides three computers to
          play against) and a standard deck of 52-cards (we use one of the
          digital variety). At the start of a round all cards are dealt. Each
          player is then required to pass three cards to a neighbour (left,
          right, across, and then no pass). Once the cards are passed the player
          with the lowest card (the Two of Clubs) plays first. Each trick
          players must follow suit if possible. The player with the highest card
          matching the suit led takes the trick and must lead the next card.
        </p>
        <p>
          Points are totalled when all the cards have been played. Each Heart is
          worth 1 point and the Queen of Spades is worth 26 points. If a player
          collects all the point cards, each other player receives 26 points.
          Round are repeated until a player exceeds 100 points, at which point
          the winner is the player with the lowest score.
